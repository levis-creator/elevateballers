# cPanel .htaccess for Node.js Application
# This file helps route requests to your Node.js application
# Note: This may not be needed if using Node.js Selector, but can help with routing

# Enable rewrite engine
RewriteEngine On

# If the request is for a file or directory that exists, serve it
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# Route all requests to your Node.js application
# Note: Node.js Selector typically handles this automatically
# This is a fallback for manual setups

# Prevent access to sensitive files
<FilesMatch "^\.">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

# Security headers (optional)
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
    Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
    Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
